# Asthma Clustering Project


# Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for an asthma clustering project. The goal of this project is to analyze asthma patient data and apply clustering techniques to group patients based on their asthma-related characteristics. Clustering helps us identify patterns and subgroups within the asthma patient population, which can be valuable for personalized healthcare and research purposes.


# Background
Asthma is a complex respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding the heterogeneity within the asthma population is essential for tailoring treatment plans and conducting research. Clustering provides a data-driven approach to identify different asthma phenotypes or subgroups based on various factors such as age, gender, symptoms, medication usage, and lung function.

# Data
Data Source: Describe the source of the asthma patient data.
Data Format: Explain the format of the data (e.g., CSV, Excel).
Preprocessing: Outline any preprocessing steps (e.g., missing data handling, feature scaling).
# Methodology
Explain the clustering algorithms and techniques used.
Discuss any feature selection or dimensionality reduction methods.
Detail the evaluation criteria used to assess the quality of clusters.
# Code explanation

Provide instructions for setting up and running the code.
Include any prerequisites or dependencies.
Offer examples of how to execute the clustering process.


We import the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, StandardScaler for data standardization, KMeans for clustering, and matplotlib for visualization.
We load the asthma patient data from a CSV file called 'asthma_data.csv'. You should replace this with the path to your dataset.
Data Preprocessing:

We use the StandardScaler to standardize the data. Standardization ensures that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can be important for some clustering algorithms like K-means.
Clustering:

We create a K-means clustering model with KMeans(n_clusters=3) to create three clusters. You can adjust the n_clusters parameter to specify the number of clusters you want.
We use the fit_predict method to assign each data point to one of the clusters.
Visualization:

We create a scatter plot to visualize the clusters based on the first two standardized features. You should replace 'Feature 1' and 'Feature 2' with the actual feature names from your dataset.
The colors represent different clusters.
Interpretation:

After running the code, you can interpret the results by analyzing the cluster assignments and the cluster centers.
This code provides a basic framework for performing asthma patient clustering using K-means. You can adapt it to your specific dataset, features, and requirements.
