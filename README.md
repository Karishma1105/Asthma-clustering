# Asthma Clustering Project


# Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for an asthma clustering project. The goal of this project is to analyze asthma patient data and apply clustering techniques to group patients based on their asthma-related characteristics. Clustering helps us identify patterns and subgroups within the asthma patient population, which can be valuable for personalized healthcare and research purposes. 


# Background
Asthma is a complex respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Understanding the heterogeneity within the asthma population is essential for tailoring treatment plans and conducting research. Clustering provides a data-driven approach to identify different asthma phenotypes or subgroups based on various factors such as age, gender, symptoms, medication usage, and lung function.

# Data
Data Source: Describe the source of the asthma patient data.
Data Format: Explain the format of the data (e.g., CSV, Excel).
Preprocessing: Outline any preprocessing steps (e.g., missing data handling, feature scaling).
# Methodology

1. Data Collection: Gather data related to asthma patients, including demographic information, medical history, symptoms, treatment details, and any other relevant features. This data could be obtained from healthcare records, surveys, or research studies.

2. Data Preprocessing:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - **Feature Selection/Extraction**: Choose relevant features that are likely to influence asthma severity or patterns.
   - **Normalization/Scaling**: Scale the features to ensure they have a similar range, which is important for k-means clustering.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the distribution of each feature and their relationships with each other.
   - Identify any patterns or trends in the data that may inform the clustering process.
   - Visualize the data using plots such as histograms, scatter plots, or heatmaps.

4. **Choosing the Number of Clusters (k)**:
   - Use techniques such as the elbow method, silhouette score, or gap statistic to determine the optimal number of clusters for the k-means algorithm.
   - Experiment with different values of k and evaluate the clustering performance.

5. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Fit the k-means clustering algorithm to the training data.
   - Optionally, perform dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA (Principal Component Analysis) before clustering if dealing with high-dimensional data.

6. **Cluster Interpretation**:
   - Analyze the characteristics of each cluster by examining the centroid (mean) of each cluster.
   - Interpret the clusters in terms of asthma severity, symptom patterns, treatment response, or any other relevant factors.
   - Visualize the clusters using techniques such as t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) or PCA to gain insights into the cluster structure.

7. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the quality of the clusters using metrics such as silhouette score, Daviesâ€“Bouldin index, or domain-specific metrics.
   - Assess whether the clusters capture meaningful patterns in the data and provide actionable insights for asthma management.

8. **Deployment and Interpretation**:
   - Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new data or integrate it into a larger asthma management system.
   - Communicate the findings and insights from the clustering analysis to relevant stakeholders, such as healthcare providers, researchers, or patients.
   - Monitor and update the model as new data becomes available or as the understanding of asthma evolves.

# Code explanation

Provide instructions for setting up and running the code.
Include any prerequisites or dependencies.
Offer examples of how to execute the clustering process.


We import the necessary libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, StandardScaler for data standardization, KMeans for clustering, and matplotlib for visualization.
We load the asthma patient data from a CSV file called 'asthma_data.csv'. You should replace this with the path to your dataset.
Data Preprocessing:

We use the StandardScaler to standardize the data. Standardization ensures that each feature has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can be important for some clustering algorithms like K-means.
Clustering:

We create a K-means clustering model with KMeans(n_clusters=3) to create three clusters. You can adjust the n_clusters parameter to specify the number of clusters you want.
We use the fit_predict method to assign each data point to one of the clusters.
Visualization:

We create a scatter plot to visualize the clusters based on the first two standardized features. You should replace 'Feature 1' and 'Feature 2' with the actual feature names from your dataset.
The colors represent different clusters.
Interpretation:

After running the code, you can interpret the results by analyzing the cluster assignments and the cluster centers.
This code provides a basic framework for performing asthma patient clustering using K-means. You can adapt it to your specific dataset, features, and requirements.
