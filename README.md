Asthma Symptoms and Their Meanings

Tiredness: Tiredness may not be a direct symptom of asthma, but it can be a secondary effect. People with asthma may feel tired due to the effort required to breathe when experiencing symptoms like difficulty in breathing.

Dry-Cough: A dry cough is a common symptom of asthma. It can be triggered or worsened by asthma-related inflammation and irritation of the airways.

Difficulty-in-Breathing: This is a classic and hallmark symptom of asthma. Asthma is characterized by the narrowing of the airways, which leads to difficulty in breathing.

Sore-Throat: Sore throat is not typically a primary symptom of asthma. However, individuals with asthma may experience a sore throat if they are coughing frequently due to their asthma symptoms.

None_Symptom and None_Experiencing: These columns suggest that some individuals in the dataset are not experiencing any of the listed symptoms, which is possible. Asthma symptoms can vary from person to person, and some individuals may have asthma but not experience symptoms all the time.

Pains: "Pains" is a bit generic, and it could refer to different types of pain. It's not a classic symptom of asthma, but individuals with asthma may experience chest discomfort or chest tightness during asthma attacks.

Nasal-Congestion and Runny-Nose: Nasal congestion and a runny nose are not typical symptoms of asthma itself. However, they may be present in individuals with allergic asthma, where allergies trigger asthma symptoms.

Age_0-9 to Age_60+: Asthma can affect individuals of all ages. Generally, asthma symptoms can vary in severity and frequency across different age groups. Children and the elderly may have different asthma symptom profiles.

Gender_Female and Gender_Male: Asthma can affect individuals of any gender. Gender may not directly cause asthma symptoms, but it can influence how asthma is managed and the prevalence of asthma in different populations.

Severity_Mild, Severity_Moderate, and Severity_None: These columns suggest different levels of severity for asthma. Asthma can indeed range from mild to moderate to severe, depending on how well it is controlled and the individual's response to treatment. The presence of these severity levels indicates the varying impact of asthma symptoms on different individuals.
